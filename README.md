#Form created with animations made in CSS

###Challenges overcome

- Making the fields appear from left to right, smoothing the entry and making them enter at different times
- When you click on Login, make the form leave the screen, going down.
- Remover formulário do html e não mostrar rolagem enquanto o formulário está saindo da tela.
- Add a different timing effect to the form's output.
- Make the form say "no" (vibrate) if there are empty fields.
- Create some animated squares (that are rotating) that come out from under the screen (out of view) and go up to the screen (out of view too). Details: Must be different sizes, come out at different times, have different timing, continuous animation.
